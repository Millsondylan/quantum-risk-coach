# Linting Issues Resolution Summary

## Overview
Successfully resolved all critical TypeScript compilation errors in the Quantum Risk Coach project. The project now builds successfully with only minor warnings that don't affect functionality.

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Critical React Hook Error (Fixed ✅)
**Issue**: React Hook `useRealTimeData` was being called inside `handleRefresh` function in `Header.tsx`
```
React Hook "useRealTimeData" is called in function "handleRefresh" that is neither a React function component nor a custom React Hook function.
```

**Solution**: Replaced the hook call with direct API calls using `realDataService`:
- Removed invalid hook usage from event handler
- Implemented direct API calls for market data refresh
- Maintained functionality while adhering to React Hook rules

### 2. Journal.tsx Trade Object Missing Properties (Fixed ✅)
**Issue**: `addTrade` function expected more properties than provided
```
Type is missing the following properties: closed_at, mt5_ticket_id, opened_at
```

**Solution**: Added missing required properties to the trade object:
- `closed_at`: Set to current timestamp if status is 'closed', null otherwise
- `opened_at`: Set to current timestamp
- `mt5_ticket_id`: Set to null for manual trades

### 3. Settings.tsx User Metadata Access (Fixed ✅)
**Issue**: `user_metadata` property doesn't exist on `LocalUser` type
```
Property 'user_metadata' does not exist on type 'LocalUser'
```

**Solution**: Implemented safe type checking:
- Created `getUserMetadata` helper function
- Check if user has `user_metadata` property (Supabase User)
- Fallback to direct property access for LocalUser
- Updated all user metadata references

### 4. MarketSessionAnalyzer Export Conflicts (Investigated ✅)
**Issue**: Reported duplicate export declarations
**Status**: No actual conflicts found - likely IDE/cache issue
**Solution**: Verified file integrity, no changes needed
