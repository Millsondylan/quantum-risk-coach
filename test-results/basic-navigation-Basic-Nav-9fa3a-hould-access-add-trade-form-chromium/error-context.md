The overall sentiment is mixed, but the recent uptick in prices suggests a potential bullish trend. **Recommendations:** 1. **BTC (1D):** * Entry: $108,000 (stop-loss: $105,000) * Target: $115,000 (take-profit: 5-7% gain) * Position Sizing: 0.5-1% of total portfolio * Reason: BTC is approaching a key resistance level at $110,000. A break above this level could indicate a stronger bullish trend, making it a good entry point. 2. **ETH (1D):** * Entry: $2550 (stop-loss: $2450) * Target: $2800 (take-profit: 10-12% gain) * Position Sizing: 1-2% of total portfolio * Reason: ETH is showing significant strength, with a strong daily candle.
